## Used technologies

**Java**: The programming language in which the project is written

**TestNG**: Test Authoring Tool used for writing Test Cases and controlling outputs.

**Rest-Assured**: Rest Assured is an open source library in Java and is used for testing HTTP Web services. This library makes it easy to create HTTP requests and process HTTP responses. Rest Assured is designed to test web services based on REST (Real Time Collaboration) architecture, but can also be applied to other types of web services.

**Junit**: JUnit is an open source test automation tool in Java language. The purpose of this tool is to provide a simple, repeatable and readable testing framework that is used to test the accuracy of your code. JUnit is very widely used in the Java world, as well as the existence of similar tools for many other languages.

**Maven**: Automation and build tool that is usually used during the compilation of commands on the Java platform.

**JSON**: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a data format used for data exchange. In this format, data is displayed in a structured way and is usually used for the storage or transmission of data returned by a web service or requested by a web.

**GSON**: Gson is an open source library in the Java language and was designed to facilitate the use of the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data format. This library automatically converts JSON data to Java objects (deserialize) and converts Java objects to JSON data (serialize).

**Lombok**: Lombok is an open source library in the Java language and was designed to increase regularity and readability in your Java code. This library aims to reduce the duplication of code blocks during the creation of Java objects, which often degrades readability.

**JavaFaler**: JavaFaker is an open source library in Java language and has the ability to generate random data. This library can be used to generate test data and can generate many different types of data, for example: names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, dates, numbers and more.

**Maven Surefire Plugin** : Maven Surefire Plugin is a plugin for an open source configuration and management tool called Apache Maven and is used to run tests written in the Java language. This plugin runs the tests specified in the configuration of the Maven project and reports the test results.
